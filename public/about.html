<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> 
  Hi <br/>
  My name is Emmanuel Everson. I am aspiring to be a software developer. I recently began my journey by taking a course on Udemy.
  I'm currently studying computer science in the university of Rivers State.
</p>

<p>
  I plan on specializing in full stack web development. So far I've learnt only HTML and I'd be proceeding to CSS after hosting this.
  Currently, I have no projects I'm working on because I'm still in my learning phase. I also have an interest in degen trading and I 
  plan on going into that too.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not coding, I find football really interesting, both playing and watching it. I believe in the importance of writing clean 
  and secure codes and producing user-centric designs. Feel free to reach out to me, I need more developers as friends.
